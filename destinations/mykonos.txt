 it its majestic windmills standing guard on the hills overlooking the sea? Is it its sun-drenched beaches or the waters of the Mediterranean twinkling like infinite precious jewels? Could it be that Apollo, born in the neighboring, sacred island of Delos wanders there, reflecting his eternal beauty? Or perhaps its narrow, winding maze of whitewashed paths leading one to endless adventure and fascination? One can only wonder, and dream of Mykonos…

Not surprisingly, Mykonos ranks among the world’s best known and most desirable destinations, attracting holiday makers from every corner of the planet.

Uniquely combining superb, sandy shores with a crystal clear sea and stunning town/hora (hora = town), Mykonos is the supreme and inimitable expression of the Cycladic architecture: radiant whites and radiant blues. To crown it all, the sacred island of Delos standing beside it displays a wealth of sights, and experiences from the civilization of Ancient Greece.

Mykonos is also at the center of an excellent network of transport and communication. By air or by sea, one arrives in Mykonos with the promise of adventure and the endless possibility for pleasure.

One and all, of whatever age, Mykonos must be experienced at least once in a lifetime…

Mykonos attracts many tourists each summer with its superb, sandy beaches, among the best to be found anywhere in Greece. As a famous poet once said,

“ Mykonos is exactly in the middle of the Aegean sea, so that every one around will look at it – and marvel at what they see.”

Agapi

Mykonos is a magical atmosphere rivaling any found on earth. In fact, the island has been called the Venice of Greece. In part, this is because of its Alefkandra quarters, a row of old houses with balconies over-hanging the Aegean. Agapi, meaning love in Greek, is waiting to be found here. From the moment your journey to Mykonos begins, you will feel the unbound power of agapi!

amphitheatrically. It has whitewashed cubic houses with wooden coloured doors, windows and balconies, narrow 
streets forming a labyrinth, beautiful churches, lovely chapels and purple bougainvilleas contrasting with the 
bright white of the buildings’ walls.<br />
The heart of the city is closed to traffic during most of the day which make the walk among the labyrinth streets 
particularly agreeable, especially during early morning when the city is calmer for most of the people are at the
beaches or still sleeping after a long night of clubbing.<br />
Numerous cafes, chic boutiques, souvenir shops and fine jewelleries are helping the visitor to enjoy its days in 
the beautiful capital of Mykonos.<br />

Another trademark of the island is Petros the pelican, usually located in Little Venice,which is quite the charmer 
and loves to pose for photographs so be sure to look for it.This peak of land consists of two-storey Venetian 
houses of extremely bright colours, built very close one to another, with coloured wooden porches and balconies, 
lining the seafront, almost falling into the sea with the waves coming to break under them; all this scene forms 
a wonderful and unique image that charms every one by its incredible beauty and its magical atmosphere.<br />

Many trendy cafes and bars are located in Little Venice which becomes a very noisy and lively area during night 
time.The capital also has an archaeological museum located between the port and the town, exposing various 
sculptures, vases and figurines coming from the islands of Delos and Rhenia. In the centre of the town one can

It’s whitewashed edifices against the backdrop of the azure blue Aegean Sea is simply marvelous. The air of nonchalance that prevails in Little Venice disarms the most discerning of travelers. The vintage fishermen’s houses for instance provide a kaleidoscopic vignette. There are many crazy international tourists who are even prepared to pay triple the amount, equivalent to a five star hotel rate just to stay in those charming fisherman’s hutments. It is a whole new world out there to be explored.
“Little Venice” evolved from the picturesque Alevkantra beach and extends right into the peripherial areas of Kastro or “Castle” as it is popularly referred to in the touristic parlance. Visitors are highly recommended to stay in one of the quaint houses that dot the Mykonos shoreline for the sheer pleasure that they afford. You can sit down with a peg or two of your favorite tipple in the quintessential wooden stairways even as the surging waves crash underneath. A truly magical aura indeed.
Little Venice is fully geared up to cater to the whims and fancies of the discerning international travelers. There are plenty of entertainment options ranging from pulsating discotheques to well-stocked bars where party animals are known to jive well past midnight. Art galleries too abound here and exhibitions of renowned artists are a regular feature. 
In the days of yore, many distinguished sailors had built their houses right on the picturesque shoreline. Many of these houses have today been converted into chic bars which are still very conspicuous by their old world charm. You can still sit down with your folks over endless pegs of your favorite liqueur and watch the solitary shipping vessel cruise by at the distant horizon creating a surreal impression.

10. Windmills
The windmills are the quintessential features of Mykonos’ landscape. There are plenty of them that have become a part and parcel of Mykonos. Visitors to Mykonos can see the windmills irrespective of the locale. 
From a distance one can easily figure out the windmills, courtesy of their silhouette. 

They are primarily concentrated in the neighborhood of Chora and some are also located in and around Alevkantra. These innovative wheels were primarily used for crushing agricultural yields. In all there were 16 such windmills in operation.
 	
They are conspicuous by their snow-white color, spherical shape with the customary pointed roof made of the finest variety of wood. In the good old days, they were wind operated as Mykonos is renowned for their gusty wind, which continues to blow even today. 

The Wind Mills of Chora and the ones at Ano Mera were a great boon to the people of those localities and they were primarily used for grinding the agricultural produce that were meant to be transported to places outside Mykonos. 

As of now, with the advent of modernity, the windmills are no longer operational. But they continue to be a symbol of Mykonos’s rich virile past. Being hundred of years old, most of the windmills have been thoroughly renovated and some have even been converted into museums, the most famous being the Bonis Windmill. 

Mykonos’s windmills are a living testimony of the island’s use of innovation when it came to tapping the enormous power of the wind to grind Mykonos’s agricultural produces.

The Church of Panagia Paraportiani in Mykonos Greece, Cyclades: The lovely church of Panagia (Virgin Mary) Paraportiani is among the most photographed churches not only in Mykonos, but in the world. It is located at the entrance of Kastro Neighbourhood, right next to the sea. Its name (Paraportiani) actually means "standing next to the entrance door", meaning that the church was next to the Castle door. 

The special thing about this church is that it actually consists of five small churches that were built one on top or next to the other. The church of Agios Efstathios is the centre of this complex, surrounded by the churches of Agios Anargyros, Agios Sozon and Agia Anastasia. On top of these four churches, there is the church of Virgin Mary, which looks like a dome.
 	

The five churches were not contructed at once, but gradually along centuries. The oldest church is Agios Anargyros, which was built in late 14th century. The other churches were built in the 16th and the 17th century, while there were renovations till 1920.

12. Delos Island
The small rocky islet of Delos is part of the Cyclades and is located a few miles south-west of Mykonos Greece.

 
 	So Leto managed to give birth to her twins, Apollo and Artemis and the island is, from then, dedicated to the beautiful god. 

This is the reason why Delos was considered as the most important Pan-Hellenic sanctuary during Ancient Times and that the ancient Greeks built a lot of amazing temples, sanctuaries and statues in this island called the “Sacred Island”.

The first inhabitants of the island were Cares or Phoenicians (3rd millennium BC).	
 	
Then, Delos came under the protection of the Ptolemies of Egypt, successors of Alexander the Great.

 
 	
According to mythology, Delos is the birthplace of Apollo, god of music, of true and light, and his twin sister Artemis, goddess of hunting. 

 

The childs’ mother was Leto who was seduced by Zeus, as many goddesses, nymphs and mortals were; when Hera, Zeus’ wife, learn about Leto’s pregnancy, she banned her from all the places of the earth so she couldn’t give birth.

The only place for Leto to give birth was the little island of Delos, then called Ortygia (Quail Island) which wasn’t considered as part of the earth and which was revealed by Poseidon, who came to help his brother and his brother’s lover.

This gave to the island its name for Delos means “revealed”. 

Because the islands around Delos were lining in the shape of a circle, the whole group of island was called the Cyclades

Dining at the Atlantida Restaurant in Platis Gialos you are likely to get some sea spray from the Aegean on your cheek. Part of the Hotel Acrogiali, a first class beachside hotel and located next door to the elegant Petasos Beach Hotel and Spa, on a private peninsula between the world famous beaches of Platis Gialos and Psarou Beach, the Atlantida Restaurant offers fruits of the ocean beside the ocean.

Just outside of Mykonos, the Atlantida is a romantic dining spot removed from the bustling scene of the town and main resort area. The luxuriant spa grounds, sculpted to reflect the cool austerity of a Cycladian village, offer a perfect backdrop. The entire peninsula is semi-exclusive and the privacy offered is much appreciated by both newlyweds and long-term couples on a romantic getaway. The panoramic beachside views are spectacular, whether you are under the shade of a complimentary umbrella or under the endless Mykonos stars. Platis Gialos is considered the best of all Mykonos beaches and the comfort of a seaside lunch followed by a soak in the sparking Aegean is a combination that provides the ultimate in relaxation.
A cool and breezy terrace, accentuated by a long bar, highlights the main dining area. If you prefer to enjoy a meal with your toes in the sand, the tables on the beach may be more your style. Each meal starts with a free serving of bruschetta, toasted bread brushed with olive oil and topped with diced tomato, olive and feta. The Atlantida salad, a variation of the more famous Greek salad, is highly recommended. Peppers stuffed with feta, personalized pizzas and calamari are amongst the lighter fare on offer. The main entrees on offer include fresh caught fish grilled and drizzled with olive oil, pan seared veal cutlets in a tomato sauce and chicken souvlaki with world famous Greek-style roasted potatoes and tzatziki, a yogurt-garlic-cucumber sauce, on the side.

After dinner, enjoy a complimentary dessert of fresh fruit or, of youâ€™re too full to eat any more, as often happens, a complimentary digestive such as Mastic or Ouzo. The friendly and attentive staff at Atlantida want to make sure you meal is delicious and, as all Greeks have always believed, a good price makes digestion easier. Adding a little extra touch is just one way the good people at Atlantida Restaurant work to keep you coming back to Platis Gialos.

14.Avra in Town, Mykonos
Named for the Greek word for "breeze", Avra restaurant is as cool and refreshing as the sea breezes that caress the holiday port of Mykonos. Elegant and austere, yet comforting and friendly, the atmosphere strikes a fine balance between accessible and exclusive. Avra's setting is a elegant & beautiful courtyard garden array with bougainvillea or the elevated roof top terrace perfect for dining under the Mykonos stars. A spacious yet cozy air con interior features an charming bar area, where owners, Nikos and Sarah welcome each guest personally and help them customize their dining experience. 

Situated in the middle of Mykonos town, Avra is conveniently located no matter which hotel you are staying at or which attraction you are taking in. Stocking a wide selection of the finest Greek red and white wines and with experienced mixologists behind the bar, the staff at Avra are fully equipped to help you relax once you do get there. Owned and managed by Niko, a former top chef at some of the restaurants in Mykonos, Avra is delighted to be able to offer you a menu created from experience and crafted with loving attention.

The Avra salad has become something of a celebrity in this town where celebrity spotting is a popular pastime. A bed of rocket, cabbage, lettuce, carrots and tomatoes support chunks of cucumber, avocado and figs and finished with walnuts, sesame seeds and parmesan cheese. The shrimp and avocado appetizer is a sensational pairing with the crisp white house wine, as are the Mussels Avra, steamed fresh mussels flavored with garlic and herbs. The flaming saganaki cheese, set aflame at your table with the help of a generous portion of ouzo, is thrilling when alight and a bubbling, gooey delight when cooled off.

A range of pastas, including a seafood pasta with fresh caught ingredients, can bridge the gap to the entrée section of the menu. Once there, you may wish you had left more room however. A chicken breast stuffed with apricots and a tender beef fillet with tangy lemon sauce are two of the local specialties, while the chateaubriand or Roquefort burger can alleviate cravings for something more familiar. The freshness of the ingredients makes the seafood risotto truly sensational, while Asian themed chicken stir fry or green beef curry are prepared with passion. The open air grill can prepare swordfish, shrimp or souvlaki, but inquiring about the catch of the day may lead to an unforgettable experience. After dinner, enjoy a coffee and liqueur with a slice of homemade dessert. Chocolate mousse, pears seethed in red wine, lemon cheesecake and panacota are just a few of the samplings to finish your dining experience. 

As refreshing as a sea breeze, the unpretentious excellence of Avra make it a must try destination for hungry vistors to Mykonos.
